# What is this

`charlie` a really simple, easy to use static file server with configurable interface through `charlie.yaml`

# Configuration options

* **http.public_folder** where to serve public static files
* **http.port** which port to listen on
* **http.web_addr** which interface to bind to

# Future work

* Enable HTTPS and configurable certificates and key file location.
